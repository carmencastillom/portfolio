    "\n",
    "This game is based on the movie called 'Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.' You will play the role of Charlie during the game. The owner of the Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka, is gifting his place to one of the lucky five individuals who win a golden pass, which is hidden in the Willy Wonka Chocolate Tablets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charlie is one of those who win a Golden Pass, and in comparison with the other four individuals, his family does not have many resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to help Charlie successfully pass the three stages of the game so that, in the end, he can win the game and gain control of the Chocolate Factory for his use! To successfully obtain a Golden Ticket, Charlie (you) needs to pass the three stages that are explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Win a ticket.\n",
    "    2. Pass one of the proofs included in the game.\n",
    "    3. Make the final decision based on what Willy Wonka is to offering him. \n",
    "    \n",
    "On the following link, SparkNotes. Flowers for Algernon:Summary. SparkNotes https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/charlie/summary/ that might help to clarify the book in case it´s needed. \n",

    "Thank you! \n"
